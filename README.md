# Automated-Threat-Detection
This repository contains simple and fundamental Projects in Computer vision (under development....)

## Overview
This process gathers large amounts of endpoint data including unusual or suspicious behaviors that may indicate the presence of malware or other threatsâ€”and alerts security teams so they can quickly identify and respond to any issues some automated threat detection usecases are:

1-Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): These projects focus on developing algorithms and techniques to detect and prevent network intrusions by monitoring network traffic for anomalies and known attack patterns.

2-Malware Detection: This project involves creating systems that can detect and classify various types of malware and malicious software by analyzing its code, behavior, and signature patterns.

3-Data Breach Detection: These projects aim to develop methods to detect unauthorized access or leakage of sensitive data by analyzing network traffic or monitoring file and user activities.

4-Phishing Detection: Phishing is a common cyber threat where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. Projects in this area focus on developing machine learning models and algorithms to identify and block phishing emails, websites, or other malicious activities.

5-Web Application Security: These projects involve developing automated tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

6-Botnet Detection: Botnets are networks of compromised computers used to carry out various malicious activities. Automated botnet detection projects focus on developing algorithms to identify and block connections or behavior that indicate the presence of a botnet.

7-Anomaly Detection: These projects aim to detect irregular or unusual activities in network traffic, system log files, or user behavior that may indicate a cyber threat or security breach.

8-Social Engineering Detection: Social engineering involves manipulating individuals to divulge confidential information or gain unauthorized access. Projects in this area focus on developing algorithms or frameworks to detect and prevent social engineering attacks.

9-Ransomware Detection: Ransomware attacks can encrypt files or lock users out of their systems until a ransom is paid. Projects in this category focus on developing techniques to detect and prevent ransomware attacks in real-time.

10-Threat Intelligence: These projects involve building automated systems to collect, analyze, and disseminate information about emerging cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and attacker techniques to enhance proactive defense and incident response capabilities.
